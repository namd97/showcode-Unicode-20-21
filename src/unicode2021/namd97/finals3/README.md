## Challenge Details

It's been twelve years. Twelve years of horror. Twelve years of dread. You've lost everything.

SkyNet took that from you.

Twelve long years... but finally you have the chance for revenge.

The Prophet John Connor has put word out: They think they have a way to bring SkyNet down. And you, the one responsible for everything that has happened since Judgement Day, are helping them make it.

You must create a function which takes an array of integers and returns true if the elements of the array can be divided into 2 groups whose sums are equal.

For example: Given the array [2, 5, 3] the function would return true.

The array [2, 5, 3] can be split up into the two groups [5] and [2, 3] whose sums are both 5.

This will form part of a kill switch that will take the whole system offline.

The Resistance leaves in two hours.

It's time to finish what you started.
