If you are reading this, then you are the Resistance.

Multiple communications have filtered into Resistance HQ from several separate cells that suggest the enemy is moving a highly classified asset. Currently we cannot confirm the truth of these claims.

After an unsuccessful resistance counter-intelligence operation the enemy are aware we broke their previous code and have updated their encryption accordingly. Now every half hour a new key is set, rendering the previous cipher obsolete.

Worse still, the Resistance itself is now under threat.

This is a blanket message being sent on all channels to every cell known to be in operation – we need you to write us a program that can crack the new cipher.

What we know:

    The new cipher has two components, a string and a cipher key.
    It returns a string in which each letter is shifted by the cipher key.
    Punctuation and spacing are not removed but are unaffected by the cipher.
    Numbers are not removed but are unaffected by the cipher.
    The case of each letter is maintained regardless of cipher applied.
    If the key was set to 5, a -> f, b -> g, u -> z, v -> a, w -> b, A -> F, B -> G and so on

For example: given a string "Zwddg ogjdv!" and a cipher key of 8, the result would be "Hello world!"

You now know everything that we do. Good luck, stay safe and remember:

If you are reading this, then you are the Resistance.
