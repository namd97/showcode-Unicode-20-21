In 410 A.D. The city of Rome was sacked and burned. A monk named Pelagius famously escaped the city and wrote an account of the event: In his writings he described the looting of the Roman capital by King Alaric.

It was written that Alaric took the treasures of ancient Rome and was buried with them following a sudden illness. No one has ever found Alaric's treasure… until now.

You have recently been contacted by someone claiming that they have a way to discover it's location. They have spent their life researching ancient texts and believe they have a 64,000 number sequence that will allow them to plot a map to the hidden fortune!

The only problem is that those 64,000 numbers are all written as roman numerals. They need someone with your skills to create a function that will convert numerals into modern integers:

    Each set of numerals is expressed as a string.
    Each string will represent one number.
    The numerals are expressed with the most significant numeral first, and the value of each numeral is simply added together.
    For example: "LXXIII" is 50 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 73.
    Where a lower valued numeral appears before a higher valued numeral it is subtracted from that higher value.
    For example: "IX" is 10 - 1 = 9.


Roman numerals are:

    M = 1000
    D = 500
    C = 100
    L = 50
    X = 10
    V = 5
    I = 1


For example:

    MMXV = 2015
    MCMLXI = 1961


If you create this function, your new contact promises to split the treasure with you "L/L"!

Are you ready to start the hunt for Alaric's treasure?
