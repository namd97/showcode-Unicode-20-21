## Challenge Details

You have been staring at the screen for hours.

You were so certain that you had the right sequence this time! but once again, the encryption requires one key, and for the thousandth time, you seem to be left with two.

Perhaps though... perhaps they are not two keys? Perhaps they are two halves of the same key?

Maybe you should try it - just to be safe. All you would need to do is merge them together, like the teeth of a cog.

Both keys are a list of string characters: write a method that returns a concatenated array that contains alternating elements from each array starting with elements from Array A.

When arrays are not the same length, the remaining elements from the longer array should be concatenated to the new array in order.

For example:

Array A: [\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"]

Array B: [\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\"]

Result: [\"a\",\"1\",\"b\",\"2\",\"c\",\"3\",\"4\"]

Maybe, just maybe this time, you will be able to open the encrypted data.
