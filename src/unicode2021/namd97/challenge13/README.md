Since the Party took control, the country has been on lockdown. Every "citizen" has been given a Chain Code - A scrambled string of letters, punctuation and spaces that represents them in the new Party system.

You have been approached by a representative of a charitable organisation - this organisation believes something terrible is going to happen to those who have not been issued with a Chain Code.

They know what information is stored within each Chain Code. What they need is a function that can convert the information into the scrambled format each code represents.

They have asked you to create that function so that they can forge new Chain Codes and smuggle those without them safely out of the country.

They will not tell you what information is stored in the codes. They give you only the following guidelines to work from:

    The code is represented by a jumbled sentence written in English.
    The sentence is represented as a single string.
    The sentence is jumbled by reorganising the letters in each word alphabetically.
    The sentence may contain both capital letters and punctuation.
    Any capitalised characters within a word should retain their position within the word (though the character itself may change).
    Similarly, any punctuation and spacing used should also remain in its original position.

For example, "The cat sat on the Ikea mat." would result in "Eht act on eht Aeik amt."

If you do this for them, they claim you will save many lives. You have two weeks before the Party acts.

Given what they have told you, you had better act fast.

After all, you have no Chain Code either.
