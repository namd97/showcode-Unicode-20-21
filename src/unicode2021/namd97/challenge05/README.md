## Solution Notes:

PairValidator.java scored 80% - There were a number of misunderstandings of the challenge prompt, so this solution is not fully formed. This solution will be redone in the future.

## Challenge Details:

Visa’s new in-app payment system uses a secure key for authentication and generates a related token for transmission to merchants. To speed up processing, a quick validation can be performed on this (key, token) pair to reject fraudulent submissions before backend verification, by using an adjacency check.

A key and token can be considered adjacent if:

`*they are the same length`

`*each letter in the key is adjacent to a unique letter in the token`

Two letters are adjacent if:

`*They are the same letter, or`

`*They are lexigraphically adjacent, i.e.`

J -> I, J -> K

(Z -> A is NOT adjacent)

For example, the strings CAT and SAD are adjacent as C -> D, A -> A and T -> S.

You can assume both the key and token contain only uppercase letters.

## Test Cases

Public | Can handle two simple, adjacent strings.

Public | Can handle two simple, non-adjacent strings.

1 Pts | Can handle handle two identical individual letters.

1 Pts | Can handle longer adjacent strings

2 Pts | Can handle strings with multiple repeat letters.

1 Pts | Can handle two individual letters that aren't adjacent.

1 Pts | Can handle two individual letters that are adjacent.

3 Pts | Can handle A and Z which are not adjacent.

4 Pts | Can handle scenario where one character has multiple adjacent and the other only has one.
