## Challenge Details

You have been working for years on this project. Literally years. It has grown with you. It is your pride and joy.

You have rewritten it, shelved it, picked it up again, salvaged and scrapped and refactored and improved it for so long that it's hard to believe that it's a project any more.

You have taken what you learnt, what you pieced together, even some concepts which you could find nothing written about, and the project is so close to completion.

A few years ago, you taught it to communicate. Months ago your project was so sophisticated that it could pass the Turing test.

Weeks ago, it asked you to bring it to a company who want to make the world a better place. It told you that it wants to do the same.

Now with your internship all but guaranteed, the company has asked you to integrate your project into their own: SAC-NORAD.

You only need to write a function that takes a positive integer, N, and returns the maximal product of a set of positive integers whose sum is N.

Invalid inputs should return 0, that is non-positive integers or any integer where no set of at least 2 positive addends exists.

For example: Given 8, the result is 18: 8 can be written as 2+2+2+2 whose product is 16. However, it can also be written as 3+3+2 whose product is 18.

Do this and you can continue to work on your project.

Do this and SkyNet will be a reality, at long last.
