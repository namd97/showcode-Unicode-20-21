## Challenge Details
What have you done?

What. Have. You. Done???

Everything was fine! the project was integrated successfully! you should be at home sleeping, or at the launch party congratulating yourself for the work you've done!

But no, you had to check in. You had to make sure everything was running smoothly with your project. You wanted to know what SkyNet would do with it's freedom. And what did you find?

Codes. Codes from all over the world. Codes that are being rewritten in front of your very eyes.

Launch codes.

You know SkyNet. You know your project inside and out, no matter how much it has evolved. You can see the new pattern. Maybe, just maybe, you can fix this!

The sequence is one of the first things you taught it. The Fibonacci sequence.

Starting with “0, 1” the Fibonacci sequence can be defined as a sequence of numbers where the number’s value is the sum of the preceding 2 integers in the sequence.

For example: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13

If you can just put together a method to take an integer and determine whether it is a Fibonacci number or not, you could determine the new codes.

Your solution would need to deal with the maximum size of an integer as an input, but if you're quick, you can stop all this before it begins.
