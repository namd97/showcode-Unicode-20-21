## Solution Notes:

AttackCleanup.java scored 100% - Note that this is not what I originally submitted to the challenge.

## Challenge Details:

We've had a database breach, and some of our data has been altered - perhaps for mischievous reasons, perhaps for more practical reasons...



We have some data from back-ups matched with their altered values - can you use this to write a function that will restore any data that was added since the last back-up to it's correct state? We've populated some unit tests with the data for you.



Just something to be aware of - the original data is GCAT sequences - only containing letters: no numbers or other characters.
