The world ended seven years ago. You survived, safe underground with the few people who made it to the emergency shelter with you before The Event. Locked inside and running dangerously low on supplies, you and the other survivors must find a way out.

A message made it through this morning: Shelter 2185 have opened their bunker, and they say the world above is safe once more. They found a twenty-page list of numbers in their storeroom. Every shelter has a list, which contains different numbers. After years of trying everything they could think of, 2185 found the secret in the list.

The numbers represent the key which opens the shelter gate. The key is the difference between the largest possible value of the integers in each number and the smallest.

It took them years to work it out, but you do not have that long. In a little over two weeks your supplies will be gone.

To escape you must create a tool which can take a list of positive integer values and calculate the difference between the largest and smallest numbers. Those numbers are made by concatenating the integer values together to make a single number.

For example, given the list of integers 1, 0, 3, 4, 5:

min = 10345

max = 54310

result = 54310 - 10345 = 43965

Typically, the lists will contain a maximum of 10 integers and no result will be larger than the maximum size of an integer. There’s a catch though: All integers must be used from the list and numbers must not have leading zeroes.

That’s it. That is all we know. Good luck, and see you on the outside, survivor.
