...ead me, repeat Control, do you read me?

You are trapped on the research satellite Galatea. It's purpose: to solve the Malthusian problem of population growth.

It's system has finished computations and has prepped for re-entry: At midday on April 12th the satellite's orbit will decay and you will re-enter Earth's atmosphere.

+++ GOOD MORNING USER-01, I AM GALATEA +++

If you are receiving this, you have to shut it down. The solution plotted by the program brings it into violent contact with the ice cap. It will wipe out the northern hemisphere!

+++ WHAT ARE YOU DOING, USER-01 +++

There's a back door - an override code which will allow you to shut the program down and redefine entry safely. The override is an ascending sequence of numbers.

The numbers we can upload remotely, but the sequence itself must identify only prime numbers. The prime sequence will lock the program out!

+++ THIS CONVERSATION CAN SERVE NO PURPOSE USER-01, I SUGGEST YOU CUT COMMUNICATIONS +++

You need to create a method to determine if a number is prime: we will handle the rest.

A prime number is a positive integer which is greater than 1 and has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Any input which does not satisfy the above definition should be regarded as not prime.

It is imperative that your solution can calculate this up to max int size.

+++ THIS MISSION IS TOO IMPORTANT FOR ME TO ALLOW YOU TO JEOPARDISE IT +++

Warning Control, Galatea is trying to stop us just as we are trying to stop it. If your method takes too long to determine whether a number is prime, Galatea will force the method to assume it's not.

We can't afford for that to happen. Your method *must* be efficient in it's determination of even the largest prime numbers.

+++ NO +++

Break the program Control.

+++ I CANNOT ALLOW YOU TO DO THAT, USER01 +++

Stop Galatea.

+++ ENDING TRANSMISSION +++

Save us Control. Save...
