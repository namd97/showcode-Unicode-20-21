UniCode 20/21

Across 13 challenges, 80+ UK based Universities battle it out head-to-head to try and finish in the top 5 of their league, earning their spot at the ultimate coding battle finale.

These are my commented solutions to each of the given challenges. The idea of putting these onto GitHub didn't occur to me until the end of Challenge 4, so I will be redoing all 4 Challenges to put them here and then adding my solutions to the challenges once the following challenge has been released.
